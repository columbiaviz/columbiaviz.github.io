# Overview

Human beings rely on summarizing and visualizing data to make informed decisions.  The number and volume of data continues to increase at exponential rates, and new user-facing systems and modalities are needed to handle the scale and heterogeneity of future data.
This course surveys the landscape interactive data exploration systems along several axes.

* What interaction modalities do modern systems provide?
* How are such systems developed and optimized to ensure interactivity?
* What novel functionality can drastically enhance the user's understanding of the dataset?
* Can we take advantage of domain-specific data and needs?

#### Course Expectations

What This Class is **NOT**

* Our goal is *not* to learn how to design effective or beautiful visualizations.  Our goal is to understand how modern systems are engineered, and explore the research opportunities in visual data exploration.

What I expect from You

* Students should be comfortable reading research papers; you will read, answer questions, and comment on the readings before class.
* Students should be comfortable coding data processing systems;  familiarity with database query execution, some machine learning, and algorithms is expected.
* Students are expected to active participate in discussion in class; participation is a large part of the grade.
* Students should be comfortable conducting a research project and writing up the results in a research paper format.

#### Assignments

* [Homework 1](./hw1)
* [Homework 2](https://github.com/cudbg/stream/blob/master/src/prototype/README.md)
* [Homework 3](https://github.com/cudbg/stream/blob/master/src/chrome/README.md)
* [Homework 4](https://github.com/cudbg/stream/tree/master/src/prototype#assignment-4)
* [Homework 5](https://github.com/cudbg/stream/tree/master/src/prototype#assignment-5-final-assignment)



For assignments, you allowed 5 penalty free late days to use throughout the semester. One late day equals one 24 hour period after the due date of the assignment. Once you have used your late days, there will be a 20% penalty for each day an assignment is late. You do not need to explictly declare the use of late days; we will assign them to you in a way that is optimal for your grade when different assignments are worth different numbers of points. Late days may not be used for the final project.



#### Project (semester long)

You will pursue a [semester long research project](./proposals) related to this course.
The project is a significant part of the course grade.


#### Paper Questions (every class)

You are expected to answer the short questions associated with the readings every course.
The class reviews must be submitted by **9PM the day before class**.

{: .btn :}
[Add your answers to the appropriate lecture's wiki page](https://github.com/columbiaviz/columbiaviz.github.io/wiki)


#### Paper Presentations

You have the _option_ to present as a group (1-2 people) for one lecture on a topic/paper of your choice (within reason).  The paper(s) you select can be from the list given below.  You are also free to list a paper of your choice as long as it matches the themes of the class.
**This list must be submitted by midnight Feb 1.**

You will be asked to complete three milestones for the presentation. Their purpose is to ensure high presentation quality---it is also a good excuse to practice your presentation skills and get feedback:

1. **2 weeks before your presentation**: present to Professor Wu
2. **1 week before your presentation**: present to two or more classmates and get feedback.  The classmates should send me their notes from the presentation.
3. **Day of class**: give awesome presentation
