# A0: Sparks Presentation
<br>

[Schedule / Sign-up Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ug-dT7Sq7HUVM-YBRUgnBv3MWheRHTsyW3OXJG2aiA/edit?usp=sharing)

In teams of 3, choose from one of the visualization practitioners/teams below that you find inspiring and prepare a short set of slides, to be presented at the beginning of class on the day for which you signed up. You may not signup for a practitioner/team that has already been taken.

Your presentation should be 7min., with 3min. afterwards for questions.

Submit your presentation (google slides or PDF only) through the [assignment form](https://goo.gl/forms/2GKkP5AnN4afmbRL2).

### Part I: Background

Describe this group/individual's body of work. Consider:
- What is their approach?
- What types of problems do they tend to tackle? What is their specialty?
- What styles of presentation do they tend to build? Who is their typical audience?

### Part II: Analyze One Project

Focus on one specific project of theirs which you find interesting. It doesn't necessarily have to be what you think is their "best" project.
Show us what it's about, how it works, and then answer:
- In what ways do you think the project is successful? In what ways do you think it could be improved?
- Which design decision did you like best? Why?
- What was their process? What were challenges along the way? What tools did they use?
