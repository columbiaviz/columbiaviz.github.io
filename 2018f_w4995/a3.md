# Assignment 3: Interactive Visualization
<br>

Working in groups of 3-4, build a visualization in D3 that enables interactive exploration of a dataset of your own choosing.

As you choose your topic, remember that you'llÂ need to complete the assignment in two weeks (your due date will seem to be three weeks out, but the midterm exam will occur in between.) Focus on designing a limited yet compelling visualization along the most interesting, rather than all, dimensions. It is also good practice to ensure that as you work, you also have an idea of what parts of the project you might cut if you run out of time. You should finish with a tightly-focused, well-implemented project rather than an ambitious but sprawling, incomplete design.

Submit your group's [Observable url](https://goo.gl/forms/2GKkP5AnN4afmbRL2) and individually, your [peer assessments](https://goo.gl/forms/YIwbN6nTnEtHZlTD2) for A3, by *Monday 10/22, 11:59pm*.

### Week 1: Static

Design an interactive graphic to communicate a compelling insight in a dataset of your choice. Consider starting by performing exploratory analysis on datasets of interest, then making divergent and then refined sketches. Create user flow sketches to help you think through the stages of interactivity you will build.

By the end of the first week you should have a static D3 visualization in Observable, loading the final version of your dataset for this assignment.

You may find it helpful to make a project plan for how you will divide up the rest of the work and complete it within the timeframe.

### Week 2: Dynamic

Add interactivity to your project. Techniques we've covered in class include panning, zooming, brushing, details-on-demand (e.g., tooltips), query filters, and selecting different measures to display. Also consider highlights, annotations, and other narrative features to draw focus to particular items or provide additional context.

In your Observable notebook, lead with your interactive visualization, including any narrative elements that may be part of its presentation. Then, include a 300-word write-up of your design decisions and process. Describe any abandoned alternative designs and describe how work was split amongst team members. Include specific technical or design challenges you encountered, as well as resources that helped you along the way.

### Grading Criteria

You should have:
-  presentation that allows for insightful exploration
-  interaction techniques fitting to the task
-  effective multi-view coordination
-  thoughtful and elegant graphic choices

We'd also love to see:
-   advanced interaction techniques
-   novel visualization elements
-   engaging narrative design

Make sure you do not have:
-   errors or broken features
-   confusing or ineffective visual encodings
-   confusing interface design or unhelpful interactions (note that poor code performance can sometimes lead to confusing interactions)
-   incomplete or poor writing
