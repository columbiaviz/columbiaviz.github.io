# A1: Play with vis systems

In this assignment, you will use three interactive visualization systems to perform visual analysis, and report on the experience.  The systems are:

* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega-lite)
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

YIRU: The dataset you will be using is _CHOOSE AN INTERESTING DATASET_.  We could use the [open policing dataset](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/), or if you have other ideas.

## Tableau

Download Tableau from [their website](https://www.tableau.com/).  Load the dataset into Tableau and answer the the following questinos:

Your task is to use Tableau to answer the following analysis questions:

1. Q1
2. Q2

YIRU: if they connect to a postgres instance, we can log the queries that are generated and executed as part of the analysis.  If there's also a way to log the tableau outputs and their timestamps, maybe we can correlated the logs with their timestamps

## Vega-lite

We have setup an observable notebook with an example vega-lite specification.  Your task is to use vega-lite to create visualizations that can be used to perform the following analysis tasks:

1. T1
2. T2

## ggplot2

Install R and ggplot2, or use the following notebook, and write two ggplot2 programs to answer the following analysis questions:

1. Q1
2. Q2
