# A1: Play with vis systems

In this assignment, you will use three interactive visualization systems to perform visual analysis, and report on the experience.  The systems are:

* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega-lite)
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

The dataset you will be using is [a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new). We select those from US, GB, DE, CA, FR and IN (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, and India, respectively) for our assignments. 


## Tableau

1. Download Tableau from [their website](https://www.tableau.com/).  

2. Connect Tableau to the hosted PostgreSQL databasethat we have set up for the course.
To do so, create a new Tableau workbook based on the following server:
  * Type: PostgreSQL (you may have to download an additional driver for postgreSQL, here)
  * Hostname: pg-001.db.gcloud.instabase.com
  * Username: columbia
  * Password: `B%38Mt5W@M*QU?Ar`
  * Database: `db_fea10998_f88d_4b6e_8f90_a6cd73bac65c`
  * You should use the table called "youtube_full"

3. Explore the dataset using Tableau, and create two visualizations to answer the following analysis questions.  Copy and paste screenshots of the visualizations into your report:
  * Q1: How long averagely a video can trend in different countries?
  * Q2: Is there any relationship between publish time (projected to 24 hours) and different categories?

4. *IMPORTANT:* Copy of your Tableau log file and send them with your results. The log file we are interested in is called "tabprotosrv.txt".
  * If you use Windows, you may find it in "My Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * On a Mac,it should be in "Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * You may find more info [here](http://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/viewing-underlying-sql-queries-desktop).

**Please make sure that the logging works before you start engaging in the exploration. ** To do so, issue a few dummy queries, open the "tabprotosrv.txt" file and make sure that it contains SQL statemements.


## Vega-lite
 
Your task is to use [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/examples/vega-lite/) to create visualizations that can be used to perform the following analysis tasks. You will use a small dataset here. 

Insert the following into your vega-lite spec to load the dataset as a vega-lite data source:

```
"data": {
  "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/columbiaviz/columbiaviz.github.io/master/_data/youtube_2020s_w6998.csv"
},
```

1. V1: Create a visualization that shows the maximum number of Likes in each category?
2. V2: Create a visualization that compares the ratio of Likes-Dislikes in different categories? (Hint: Compute each video's  Likes-Dislikes and then compute the average within one category.  Always add 1 to dislikes to avoid dividing by 0.)

## ggplot2

Your task is to write two ggplot2 programs to perform visual analysis.  

#### Setup

Install R and ggplot2, and write two ggplot2 programs to answer the following analysis questions. 
The dataset is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/columbiaviz/columbiaviz.github.io/master/_data/youtube_full_2020s_w6998.csv).

If you do not want to install R, you can also use the hosted Jupyter on [Instabase here](https://instabase.com/user/ewu-nb/tree/ewu/test/fs/Instabase%20Drive/notebooks/a1_r_vis.ipynb). 
The notebook provides some scaffolding code to get you started.  To use it, create an account on the instabase website below (note that this URL is special for this class).
The service is still in beta, so:

* USE THE FOLLOWING TOKEN IN ORDER TO REGISTER: `ewu-columbia`
* Go to https://www.instabase.com/account/register?use_token=true
* Make sure you sign up with your `AB1235@columbia email`!!!
* If you did not register using the token, you can still enter the token at this login page: https://www.instabase.com/account/login?use_token=true

Once you have created an account, you can

* [open the Jupyer notebook](https://instabase.com/user/ewu-nb/tree/ewu/test/fs/Instabase%20Drive/notebooks/a1_r_vis.ipynb),
* copy it into your repository
* right click on the file in your repository and open as Notebook.

#### The Tasks

1. G1: Create a visualization that shows the number of trending videos in each category. (Hint: please count the unique videos.)
2. G2: Create a visualization so that, for each country and each category, we can compare the ration of  Views to Comments. (Hint: Compute each video's  Views-Comments and then compute average.  Always add 1 to Comments to avoid dividing by 0.)


# Submission Instructions

You need to submit two files:
* A report named "UNI\_Firstname\_Lastname\_report.pdf" [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/0wSQU5JaVJvzXDHl97Mg) and 
* The log from Tableau named "UNI\_tabprotosrv.txt" [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/9PsN3uvTXtnsG6rbwFHM).  

The report should contain
* a paragraph that compares and contrasts the three tools.  What is each great at?  good at?  bad at?  What do you hope each could do better?
* the source code and visualization of vegalite and gglot2, 
* the screenshots from tableau; make sure to include the Columns and Rows definitions in your screenshots

We will assess based on the source code and visualization.  The easier the report is to read, the better we will be able to assess it.  All reasonable efforts at analysis will be given credit.
