# A1: Play with vis systems

In this assignment, you will use three interactive visualization systems to perform visual analysis, and report on the experience.  The systems are:

* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega-lite)
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

The dataset you will be using is [a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new). We select US, GB, DE, CA, FR and IN (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, and India, respectively) for our assignments. 


## Tableau

1. Download Tableau from [their website](https://www.tableau.com/).  

2. Connect Tableau to the hosted PostgreSQL databasethat we have set up for the course.
To do so, create a new Tableau workbook based on the following server:
  * Type: PostgreSQL (you may have to download an additional driver for postgreSQL, here)
  * Hostname: pg-001.db.gcloud.instabase.com
  * Username: columbia
  * Password: `B%38Mt5W@M*QU?Ar`
  * Database: `db_fea10998_f88d_4b6e_8f90_a6cd73bac65c`
  * You should use the table called "youtube_full"

3. Explore the dataset using Tableau, and create two visualizations to answer the following analysis questions.  Copy and paste screenshots of the visualizations into your report:

  * Q1: How long averagely a video can trend in different countries?
  * Q2: Is there any relationship between publish time (projected to 24 hours) and different categories?

4. *IMPORTANT:* Copy of your Tableau log file and send them with your results. The log file we are interested in is called "tabprotosrv.txt".
  * If you use Windows, you may find it in "My Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * On a Mac,it should be in "Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * You may find more info [here](http://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/viewing-underlying-sql-queries-desktop).

Please make sure that the logging works before you start engaging in the exploration. To do so, issue a few dummy queries, open the "tabprotosrv.txt" file and make sure that it contains SQL statemements.


## Vega-lite
 
Your task is to use [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/examples/vega-lite/) to create visualizations that can be used to perform the following analysis tasks. You will use a small dataset here. 

Insert `  "data": {"url": "data/movies.json"},` to specify your dataset in vega-lite code.

1. T1 What is the maximum likes number in each category?
2. T2 What is the ratio of Likes-Dislikes in different categories? (Hint: Compute each video's  Likes-Dislikes and then compute average within one category.  Always add 1 to dislikes to avoid divide by 0.)

## ggplot2

Install R and ggplot2, and write two ggplot2 programs to answer the following analysis questions. The dataset is [here]().

1. Q1 How many top trending videos in each category? (Hint: please count the unique videos.)
2. Q2 For each country and each category, what is the ratio of Views-Comments? (Hint: Compute each video's  Views-Comments and then compute average.  Always add 1 to comments to avoid divide by 0.)


# Submission Instructions

You need to submit a report named "Firstname\_Lastname\_UNI\_report.pdf" [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/0wSQU5JaVJvzXDHl97Mg) and "UNI\_tabprotosrv.txt" from Tableau [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/9PsN3uvTXtnsG6rbwFHM).  

In the report, make sure to **include the source code and visualization of vegalite and gglot2 and the screenshot from tableau**.  We will grade based on the source code and visualization. **For Tableau, we also care about the columns and rows definition**. Make sure to include it in your screenshots. We will credit all the reasonable analysis.
