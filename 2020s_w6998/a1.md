# A1: Play with vis systems

In this assignment, you will use three interactive visualization systems to perform visual analysis, and report on the experience.  The systems are:

* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega-lite)
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

The dataset you will be using is [a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new). We select those from US, GB, DE, CA, FR and IN (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, and India, respectively) for our assignments. 


## Tableau

1. Download Tableau from [their website](https://www.tableau.com/).  

2. Connect Tableau to the hosted PostgreSQL databasethat we have set up for the course.
To do so, create a new Tableau workbook based on the following server:
  * Type: PostgreSQL (you may have to download an additional driver for postgreSQL, here)
  * Hostname: pg-001.db.gcloud.instabase.com
  * Username: columbia
  * Password: `B%38Mt5W@M*QU?Ar`
  * Database: `db_fea10998_f88d_4b6e_8f90_a6cd73bac65c`
  * You should use the table called "youtube_full"

3. Explore the dataset using Tableau, and create two visualizations to answer the following analysis questions.  Copy and paste screenshots of the visualizations into your report:
  * Q1: How long averagely a video can trend in different countries?
  * Q2: Is there any relationship between publish time (projected to 24 hours) and different categories?

4. *IMPORTANT:* Copy of your Tableau log file and send them with your results. The log file we are interested in is called "tabprotosrv.txt".
  * If you use Windows, you may find it in "My Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * On a Mac,it should be in "Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * You may find more info [here](http://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/viewing-underlying-sql-queries-desktop).

**Please make sure that the logging works before you start engaging in the exploration. ** To do so, issue a few dummy queries, open the "tabprotosrv.txt" file and make sure that it contains SQL statemements.


## Vega-lite
 
Your task is to use [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/examples/vega-lite/) to create visualizations that can be used to perform the following analysis tasks. You will use a small dataset here. 

Insert the following into your vega-lite spec to load the dataset as a vega-lite data source:

```
"data": {
  "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/columbiaviz/columbiaviz.github.io/master/_data/youtube_2020s_w6998.csv"
},
```

1. V1: What is the maximum Likes number in each category?
2. V2: What is the ratio of Likes-Dislikes in different categories? (Hint: Compute each video's  Likes-Dislikes and then compute the average within one category.  Always add 1 to dislikes to avoid dividing by 0.)

## ggplot2

Install R and ggplot2, and write two ggplot2 programs to answer the following analysis questions. The dataset is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/columbiaviz/columbiaviz.github.io/master/_data/youtube_full_2020s_w6998.csv).

1. G1 How many trending videos in each category? (Hint: please count the unique videos.)
2. G2 For each country and each category, what is the ratio of Views-Comments? (Hint: Compute each video's  Views-Comments and then compute average.  Always add 1 to Comments to avoid dividing by 0.)


# Submission Instructions

You need to submit two files:
* A report named "UNI\_Firstname\_Lastname\_report.pdf" [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/0wSQU5JaVJvzXDHl97Mg) and 
* The log from Tableau named "UNI\_tabprotosrv.txt" [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/9PsN3uvTXtnsG6rbwFHM).  

The report should contain
* the source code and visualization of vegalite and gglot2, 
* the screenshots from tableau; make sure to include the Columns and Rows definitions in your screenshots

We will assess based on the source code and visualization.  The easier the report is to read, the better we will be able to assess it.  All reasonable efforts at analysis will be given credit.
