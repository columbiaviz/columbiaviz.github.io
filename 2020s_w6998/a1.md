# A1: Play with vis systems

In this assignment, you will use three interactive visualization systems to perform visual analysis, and report on the experience.  The systems are:

* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega-lite)
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

YIRU: The dataset you will be using is _CHOOSE AN INTERESTING DATASET_.  We could use the [open policing dataset](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/), or if you have other ideas.

## Tableau

1. Download Tableau from [their website](https://www.tableau.com/).  

2. Connect Tableau to the hosted PostgreSQL databasethat we have set up for the course.
To do so, create a new Tableau workbook based on the following server:
  * Type: PostgreSQL (you may have to download an additional driver for postgreSQL, here)
  * Hostname: pg-001.db.gcloud.instabase.com
  * Username: columbia
  * Password: `B%38Mt5W@M*QU?Ar`
  * Database: `db_fea10998_f88d_4b6e_8f90_a6cd73bac65c`
  * You should use the table called "XXX"

3. Explore the dataset using Tableau, and create two visualizations to answer the following analysis questions.  Copy and paste screenshots of the visualizations into your report:
  * Q1:
  * Q2:

4. *IMPORTANT:* Copy of your Tableau log file and send them with your results. The log file we are interested in is called "tabprotosrv.txt".
  * If you use Windows, you may find it in "My Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * On a Mac,it should be in "Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * You may find more info [here](http://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/viewing-underlying-sql-queries-desktop).

Please make sure that the logging works before you start engaging in the exploration. To do so, issue a few dummy queries, open the "tabprotosrv.txt" file and make sure that it contains SQL statemements.


<b>YIRU: if they connect to a postgres instance, we can log the queries that are generated and executed as part of the analysis.  If there's also a way to log the tableau outputs and their timestamps, maybe we can correlated the logs with their timestamps</b>

## Vega-lite

We have setup an observable notebook with an example vega-lite specification.  Your task is to use vega-lite to create visualizations that can be used to perform the following analysis tasks:

1. T1
2. T2

## ggplot2

Install R and ggplot2, or use the following notebook, and write two ggplot2 programs to answer the following analysis questions:

1. Q1
2. Q2
