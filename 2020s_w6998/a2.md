# A2: Visualization Design Recommendations

Draco is a system that models visualization design as a constraint problem based on [Answer Set Programming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming).  It is meant to be used as a recommendation engine within an exploration or recommendation tool such as Voyager.  In this assignment, you will try your hand at writing Draco specifications, XYZ, and comment on the experience.

Go to this [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/80b293624d026844) and implement the `createDracoProgram()` function.
