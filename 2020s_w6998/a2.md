# A2: Visualization Design Recommendations

Due: 2/5/20 11:59PM EST

You are going to have experience with two visualization design recommendation techniques: Draco and Voyager.

## Draco

[Draco](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2019-Draco-InfoVis.pdf) is a system that models visualization design as a constraint problem based on [Answer Set Programming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming).  It is meant to be used as a recommendation engine within an exploration or recommendation tool such as Voyager.  In this assignment, you will try your hand at writing Draco specifications, XYZ, and comment on the experience.

Go to this [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/80b293624d026844) and

1. Create an account and fork the notebook
2. implement the `createDracoProgram()` function.
3. Click "publish" in your notebook and remember the URL

## Voyager

You will use Voyager for data exploration and report your thoughts

* Go to [the voyager website](https://vega.github.io/voyager/) and load the "Birdstrikes" dataset.  This is a dataset from the Federal Aviation Agency which collects instances of birds that strike planes, as self-reported by airlines, pilots, and airports.  
* Use the tool to identify two interesting facts from the dataset.
* Reflect on the ways that Voyager assisted your analysis, as well as ways where it was not useful or negatively impacted your analysis process.
