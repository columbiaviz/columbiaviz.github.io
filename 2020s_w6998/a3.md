# A3: Play with Extraction

In this assignment, you will try out interfaces for data and text extraction.  Trifacta Wrangler is an interface that employs a programming-by-example interaction modality.    


Datasets:


1. [2013films.txt](/files/hdisys/2013films.txt):  A dataset of all the movies in 2013 from January to March. It contains Movie name, Production house, Genre, Publisher and other details.


## Wrangler: text extraction


Download [Trifacta desktop from their website](https://www.trifacta.com/start-wrangling/).  


Some tips using Wrangler:

* Check out the introduction [video](https://vimeo.com/19185801) to get a feel of how wrangler works.
* You may wanna start off by loading ~50 lines of data instead of the entire files and play around with the tool.
* Wrangler responds to mouse highlights and clicks on the displayed table cells by suggesting operations on the left sidebar.  
* Hovering over each element shows the result in the table view.  
* Clicking adds the operation.  
* Clear the sidebar by clicking the colored row above the schema row.

#### Your Task

Load the 2013films dataset into Wrangler, and then use the tool to generate output as follows, i.e., Movie name, Production/Distribution house, Director, Genre and publisher. 

	A dark truth, Magnolia Pictures, Damian Lee, Action,ComingSoon.net
	Table No. 21, Eros International, Aditya Datt, Thriller, BoxOfficeMojo.com
    [...more rows...]

For the purpose of explanation columns are separated by `||`. You can choose any pattern to extract information. 

1. Movie name can be identified as first column in every line formatted as ``[[ <movie name> ]]`` 
1. Production/Distribution house is the following column that is formatted as ``[[< Production house>]]``
1. Director name can be identified with `(director)` tag that follows the name  
1. Genre is present in the next column but make sure to extract only second part that is separated by the `|` operator. For eg. in `[Action film|Action]` relevant information is Action  
1. Publisher name can be identified in the last column with format `publisher=<publisher name>`
1. It may help to skip first few lines that contains html code, so that you process actual records.


#### Questions

* Use wrangler to clean the data, then determine which Production/Distribution house produced maximum movies.

#### Notes
* Your wrangler script is not expected to be sophisticated enough to generate the results for the question asked. It just needs to clean/combine the data enough for you to observe the data and answer the question.
* You can export the wrangler "recipe" (script) as follows.  It is simply a text file with a sequence of transformations:
* <img src="/files/hdisys/wrangler-export.gif" style="width: 400px;"/>



## (optional) Programming by Example

Synsh is a web application that synthesizes bash shell scripts that transform an input text file into an example output file.
