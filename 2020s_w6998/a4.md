# A4: Play with SIEUFERD/Ultorg

Due: April 6 11:59PM (EST)

In this assignment, you will try out Ultorg, a visual query interface for relational databases. Ultorg is the commercial successor to the SIEUFERD project at MIT, as described in the SIGMOD '16 paper: [Expressive Query Construction through Direct Manipulation of Nested Relational Results](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ebakke/research/sieuferd_sigmod2016.pdf)

Watch the query system demo from the SIGMOD paper:

## Installation

The Ultorg software is a desktop application which runs on Windows, MacOS, or Linux. It is currently under development--you will be playing with a pre-release version.

By March 27, you should have received an email with a link to download a pre-release version of the Ultorg software. If not, you can email Eirik Bakke ([ebakke@ultorg.com](mailto:ebakke@ultorg.com)).

The email will include instructions for starting the application and opening the demo database, which is an academic course catalog containing several semesters' worth of data from Princeton University.

Note that the pre-release version of Ultorg does not save your work; we will ask you to take screenshots of queries that you produce for this exersise.

## Background

Ultorg is a [direct manipulation interface](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/papers/Shneiderman1983Direct.pdf) for creating queries and visualizations over an arbitrary relational database. Relational databases tend to have many tables of data, representing business entities and the relationships between them. In typical business scenarios, it becomes necessary to visualize these relationships from a number of different "perspectives", depending on the business task at hand. Ultorg lets users create such perspectives without custom coding.

In Ultorg, a perspective is a single concept that defines both a database query and its visualization (formatting). Possible perspectives include the visual equivalent of any SQLâ€‘92 query, visualizations such as crosstabs, calendars, bar charts, and kanban boards, as well as non-tabular multi-query visualizations such as forms, dashboards, and hierarchical reports. This covers every kind of data display that is seen in traditional tailor-made database applications.

## Your Task

Your task is to produce the following perspectives in Ultorg, based on the "course catalog" demo database.  For each of the perspectives, *take a screenshot to paste into a PDF that you will submit as your report*.  The cool part of Ultorg is that the layout _is_ the query, thus a screenshot is sufficient!


#### Perspective 1

Show a list of courses, including all available information for each course, including meeting times, instructors assigned to each meeting, and assigned readings. Filter to include the term "S06-07" only.  Show the results using a multi-column form-style layout:

#### Perspective 2

Show a list of instructors, ordered descending by total time assigned to non-canceled meetings ("status" not equal to "X"), along with the courses taught by each instructor, laid out in a tabular fashion. Show the total teaching time for each instructor as a separate table column, with a bar chart visualization. Filter to include the term "S06-07" only.

For finding the length of a section in hours, use the formula `diffDayFract([End Time], [Beg Time]) * 24`.


#### Perspective 3 (optional and encouraged!)

Show a list of professors (instructors) who tend to assign their own textbooks as reading materials for their classes. (You can match author names exactly, or try to be more clever.)


### Hints

* To create a new perspective, right click a table in the "Data Tables" list, and click "Create Perspective".

* You can right-click on any column of data in the output pane to open the context menu. All query-related actions are initiated from this menu.

* The "Fields" popup (opened via "Fields and Joins..." in the context menu) is frequently used.

* In the "Fields" popup, you can hold down shift or to select multiple fields, and press space to check/uncheck them all.
* You will also need the sum function.
* While editing a formula, you can click around to insert new references, like in a spreadsheet.
