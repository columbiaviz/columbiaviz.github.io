# A1: Play with vis systems

Due: TBA


In this assignment, you will use three interactive visualization systems to perform visual analysis, and report on the experience.  The systems are:

* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega-lite)

<!--
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
-->

The dataset you will be using is [a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new). We select those from US, GB, DE, CA, FR and IN (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, and India, respectively) for our assignments. 


## Tableau

#### Setup

1. Download Tableau from [their website](https://www.tableau.com/).  

2. Connect Tableau to the hosted PostgreSQL databasethat we have set up for the course.
To do so, create a new Tableau workbook based on the following server:
  * Type: PostgreSQL (you may have to download an additional driver for postgreSQL, here)
  * Hostname: pg-001.db.gcloud.instabase.com
  * Username: columbia
  * Password: `B%38Mt5W@M*QU?Ar`
  * Database: `db_fea10998_f88d_4b6e_8f90_a6cd73bac65c`
  * You should use the table called "youtube_full"


#### Your Task

Explore the dataset using only Tableau.  Create visualizations to answer the following analysis questions.  Copy and paste screenshots of the visualizations into your report:

* Q1: For each country, how many days on average does a video trend?  
* Q2: Is there any relationship between the hour of the day that a video was published and the category of the video?
* Q3: What is the difference between the average likes and dislikes per video category?

*IMPORTANT:* 

* Copy of your Tableau log file and send them with your results. The log file we are interested in is called "tabprotosrv.txt".
  * On Windows, you may find it in "My Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * On MacOS, it should be in "Documents/My Tableau Repository/Logs".
  * You may find more info [here](http://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/viewing-underlying-sql-queries-desktop).
* **Please make sure that the logging works before you start engaging in the exploration.** To do so, issue a few dummy queries, open the "tabprotosrv.txt" file and make sure that it contains SQL statemements.


## Vega-lite
 
Your task is to use [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/examples/vega-lite/) to create visualizations that can be used to perform the following analysis tasks.  You will submit a sharable link that you can access by clicking on "Share" and then "Copy Link to Clipboard" in the vega-lite editor

**Vega-lite is browser-based, so you will use a small dataset here.**  To do so, insert the following into your vega-lite spec to load the dataset as a vega-lite data source:

```
"data": {
  "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/columbiaviz/columbiaviz.github.io/master/_data/youtube_2020s_w6998.csv"
},
```

1. V1: Create a visualization that shows the maximum number of Likes in each category.
2. V2: Create a visualization that compares the ratio of Likes-Dislikes in different categories. Hint: Compute each video's  Likes-Dislikes and then compute the average within one category.  Always add 1 to dislikes to avoid dividing by 0.
