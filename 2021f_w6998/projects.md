## Important Dates 

Percentages are of your total class grade.

* Proposal    10-01   (5%)
* Paper Draft   10-29  (5%)
* Presentation  12-10  (5%)
* Report        12-14   (35%)



## Overview

The major portion of your grade is based on the research project. Students will organize into teams of 1-2 students and work on a research project.  It should take about 3-4 weeks to complete.  Some possible ideas are [described below](#suggestions).

Teams should consist of 1-2 people (we may adjust this depending on the size of the class). In addition, if you have a project in mind, please discuss it with Eugene well ahead of time. We have also included a list of possible projects at the end of this document although you are not required to choose from these.

Good class projects can vary dramatically in complexity, scope, and topic. The only requirement is that they be related to something we have studied in this class and that they contain some element of research -- e.g., that you do more than simply engineer a piece of software that someone else has described or architected. To help you determine if your idea is of reasonable scope, we will arrange to meet with each group several times throughout the semester.

Choosing a research problem is very difficult, especially if you have not done so before.  You may end up thinking of, and discarding many possibilities before finding the project you ultimately work on.  Have a fuzzy idea?  Want some feedback or help brainstorming a project?  **Come to office hours and/or recitation.  The staff are all here to help!**


<a name="proposal" />
## Proposal

Your research proposal will contain an overview of the research problem, _your hypothesis_, first pass at related work, a description of how you plan to complete the project, and metrics to decide _if it worked_.   


We have setup a template for your proposal on overleaf.  Clone it into your team's account to edit it.  Make sure to change the title and author names, and include your team members' UNIs.


Submission

1. Use the [proposal template on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xhpgqyqbghry)
1. [Click here to submit](https://www.dropbox.com/request/ADp0JEHMjMSDvBCo6KIv)



## <a name="checkin"/>Check in

Your group will schedule 20 minutes to meet with Professor Wu to go over the project's progress and receive feedback.    The first 5 minutes will consist of a short 5 minute presentation with 4 slides (roughly 1 minute per slide).  The rest of the time will be an open discussion and fielding questions.

Slides should cover:

1. Problem and motivation
2. Related work and challenges
3. Progress so far
4. Plan for rest of the project

Submission

* [Click here to sign up for an appointment during week of 3/23 to 3/27](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUlmUlc5VDIwWDJwfGRlZmF1bHR8MTUwY2E3NDBiMDNhMTU4ZDIyODhlMjFlZTAzZGMyZTU)





<a name="draft" />
## Paper Draft

You will submit a draft of your paper that should be between 4 -- 6 pages. Please use the [overleaf report template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/phmrptrtjrhz) to get started.  It already contains a scaffold of sections, and suggestions of what to include in each section.  Your report is not beholden to these sections, so take the template as a starting point.  

You will notice that the structure is different from the proposal, as there is more emphasis on the technical details and related work.  Since this is a draft, the submission is not expected to be fully complete.  However, you should have a fleshed out introduction, related work, and technical overview.  

You should have a complete related works section, and have identified how the main relevant papers are similar and different from your project.  

You should have a clear description of the technical details and anticipated potential issues, but may have not started implementation.   You do not need to have run experiments yet, but should have a set of hypotheses as well as a potential experiment setup (which may change). If you have preliminary findings, that's great!  Please include those.

Submission

1. Use the [report template on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/phmrptrtjrhz)
1. [Click here to submit your **4 -- 6 page** draft](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=w611320)
  * Please see [this draft from a previous class](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y460nkyi7pmnkre/example%20draft.pdf?dl=0) as an example.





## <a name="showcase"/>Project Showcase 

Your team will prepare and present a project poster at the end-of-course showcase session.   This gives you an opportunity to present a short presentation demo of your work and show what you have accomplished in the class!  

Your presentation should be polished.  Since there is still time until the final report, you are encouraged to also discuss ideas or challenges you are still considering.  

**Since you are presenting to your peers as well, make sure you give your colleagues enough context to understand your ideas.  In addition to _what_ you did, help your colleagues understand _why_ you made your specific choices, and provide examples.  It's better to make sure the audience learns a few specific ideas than try to say everything.**  Come to office hours or contact the staff if you would like feedback.

Overall logitics

* 2 person teams: 6 min presentation, 5 min feedback
* 1 person teams: 5 min presentation, 4 min feedback
* Timing is strict since we have many groups.  *Practice ahead of time so your presentation is smooth!  Only takes 5/6 minutes per practice :)*
* Each team member should speak
* Make sure all demos are embedded as GIFs or videos in your slides.
* Staff will host and share their screen; we will change slides on your behalf

Your presentation should cover (in content, not necessarily one slide for each point)

* Motivation and *scientific hypotheses*
* Technical challenge and contribution
* Related work and how they are related
* Simple example to illustrate idea
* Technical insights/experimental findings so far
* GIF/video of demos/screenshots (if applicable)
* Feedback: 1-3 questions youâ€™d like feedback on

**Submission**

* Submit URL to your group's [PDF file or google slides](https://forms.gle/av9k4XUuaEeDC2dc6)



## Report/Camera Ready

You will revise your draft and submit a conference-style report on your project, with **maximum length** of 12 pages. 
Because this report is the primary deliverable upon which you will be graded, **do not treat it as an afterthought**. Plan to leave at least a week to do the writing, and make sure your proofread and edit carefully!

# Project Suggestions

The following are examples of possible projects -- they are by no means a complete list and **you are free to select your own projects**.  In fact, a common source of ideas is to take your experience from another domain, and combine it with ideas from human data interaction.  Another approach is to take concepts from the papers we read, and apply them to another domain.  Projects often come in several flavors:

1. Research project: model an unsolved problem, propose or extend an algorithmic solution, evaluate and report findings.
2. Design: identify an underserved data problem for which a sound, composable interface doesn't exist, propose an interface and interaction design, build and evaluate it.
3. Fill a gap:  think about something useful that _should_ be easily doable, but is painful or impossible with current state of the art.  Fill that gap.

### Explanation and Debugging

Scorpion/DIFF for SQLite

Translate sql into data frame statements, maintain bidirectional mapping, allow stepwise debugging in data frame, translate fixes back to SQL


### Lineage

Develop and use lineage

* sharing, B3++
* UI-data interplay

### Interaction Design

integrate VCA into a vis library
Extend VCA to arbitrary workflows

* Given the coarse and fine-grained provenance, what outputs of data processing 
  workflows can be compared?
  * more generally, when selecting marks in a vis, what representations 
    can it have?

### Interface Generation

* extend PrecisionI (new languages, interaction)

### Performance
