### Visualization Toolkits

A variety of useful toolkits have been designed to help support information visualization applications. Some include support for the full visualization pipeline from data to interactive graphics, while others focus only on a subset, typically graphics and interaction.

-   [D3](https://d3js.org) – A JavaScript library for data-driven DOM manipulation, interaction and animation. Includes utilities for visualization techniques and SVG generation.
-   [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) – A declarative language for representing visualizations. Vega will parse a visualization specification to produce a JavaScript-based visualization, using either HTML Canvas or SVG rendering. Vega is particularly useful for creating programs that produce visualizations as output.
-   [Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite) – A high-level visualization grammar that compiles concise specifications to full Vega specifications.
-   [Processing](http://processing.org/) or [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) – A popular Java-like graphics and interaction language and IDE. Processing has a strong user community with many examples. p5.js is a sister project in JavaScript.
-   [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) – an open-source C++ graphics library popular for video and media installations, similar approach to Processing.
-   [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) – a popular open-source mapping library
-   [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) – A scientific visualization library (C++ with wrappers for other languages)
-   [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) – built on top of D3, offers abstractions that enable building interactive visualizations very quickly with well-known charts.
-   [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) – designed for high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets in web browsers. By Anaconda team.
-   [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) – A Python-based visualization library with visually defensible defaults that builds on [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).
-   [Chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs/) – A color-math library for JavaScript capable of generating perceptually uniform color mappings.
