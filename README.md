# `datavis.cs.columbia.edu` website

This repository contains an [Astro](https://astro.build)-based static site generator that will publish to Github Pages when new commits are pushed.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ archive/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ old-jekyll-sites
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ archived-course-1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ archived-course-2
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ static-file.xyz
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ PageElement.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ course-3
â”‚       |   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ course-4
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
