### Tableau Resources

- [Tableau Training](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training): Specifically the *Getting Started* video and *Visual Analytics* section. Most helpful when first getting off the ground.

- [Build-It-Yourself Exercises](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/help.html#dataview_examples.html): Specifically, sections *Build Charts and Analyze Data* > *Build Common / Advanced Chart Types*, and *Build Data Views From Scratch > Analyze Data* are a good documentation resource.

- [Drawing With Numbers](http://rawingwithnumbers.artisart.org/): blog with example walkthroughs in the *Visualizations* section, and *Tableau Wiki* has a bunch of useful links for the most common advanced exploratory / visualization Tableau techniques.
