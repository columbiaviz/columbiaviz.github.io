### D3 Resources

- [D3 In Depth](https://d3indepth.com/): Code notebook/textbook-like blog that aims to bridge intro textbooks and D3 official documentation.
- [D3: Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/13137514): O'Reilly book available online through CU libraries.
- [Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/): Bostockâ€™s code-sharing platform that is the predecessor of Observable; it is the most thorough repository of D3 examples by virtue of having been around since the beginning, but note that most examples are built on D3@V4 or older.
- [Observable D3 Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery): D3 templates and examples organized by type, mostly authored by Bostock, e.g. [Methods of Comparison Compared](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/methods-of-comparison-compared)
- [Observable Visualization Collection](https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/visualization): D3@V5 showcase from Bostock as well as many others.
- [Observable Forums](https://talk.observablehq.com/): includes tips specific to Observable platform, e.g. [How to load css files](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/how-to-load-css-files/101/2)
