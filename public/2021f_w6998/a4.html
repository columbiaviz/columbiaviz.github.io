<ul>
  <li>Due: Nov 19 11:59PM (EST)</li>
  <li>Teams of 1 - 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Edits</p>

<ul>
  <li>11/13:
    <ul>
      <li>included the google form questions into this document.</li>
      <li>pushed deadline back from 15th to 16th</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this assignment, you will try out interfaces for data and text extraction.</p>

<h2 id="wrangler-data-prep">Wrangler: data prep</h2>

<p>Trifacta Wrangler is an interface that employs a programming-by-example interaction modality.</p>

<p>Datasets:</p>

<p><a href="/files/hdisys/2013films.txt">2013films.txt</a>:  A dataset of all the movies in 2013 from January to March. It contains Movie name, Production house, Genre, Publisher and other details.</p>

<p>Access <a href="https://www.trifacta.com/start-wrangling/">Trifacta for students from their website</a>.</p>

<p>Some tips using Wrangler:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check out the introduction <a href="https://vimeo.com/19185801">video</a> to get a feel of how wrangler works.</li>
  <li>You may wanna start off by loading ~50 lines of data instead of the entire files and play around with the tool.</li>
  <li>Wrangler responds to mouse highlights and clicks on the displayed table cells by suggesting operations on the left sidebar.</li>
  <li>Hovering over each element shows the result in the table view.</li>
  <li>Clicking adds the operation.</li>
  <li>Clear the sidebar by clicking the colored row above the schema row.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="your-task">Your Task</h4>

<p>Load the 2013films dataset into Wrangler, and then use the tool to generate output as follows, i.e., Movie name, Production/Distribution house, Director, Genre and publisher.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A dark truth, Magnolia Pictures, Damian Lee, Action,ComingSoon.net
Table No. 21, Eros International, Aditya Datt, Thriller, BoxOfficeMojo.com
[...more rows...]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the purpose of explanation columns are separated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">||</code>. You can choose any pattern to extract information.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Movie name can be identified as first column in every line formatted as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[ &lt;movie name&gt; ]]</code></li>
  <li>Production/Distribution house is the following column that is formatted as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[&lt; Production house&gt;]]</code></li>
  <li>Director name can be identified with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(director)</code> tag that follows the name. Just extracting one name near the tag would be enough.</li>
  <li>Genre is present in the next column but make sure to extract only second part that is separated by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> operator. For eg. in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Action film|Action]</code> relevant information is Action</li>
  <li>Publisher name can be identified in the last column with format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">publisher=&lt;publisher name&gt;</code></li>
  <li>It may help to skip first few lines that contains html code, so that you process actual records.</li>
</ol>

<p>Questions you will submit in the google form</p>

<ol>
  <li>Which production/distribution house produced the maximum movies?</li>
  <li>What is the most popular genre?</li>
  <li>Share your experience with Trifacta. Which part of the cleaning procedure does it make easier? Which part is hard? Any comments on Trifacta, pros or cons or further improvements.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Your wrangler script is not expected to be sophisticated enough to generate the results for the question asked. It just needs to clean/combine the data enough for you to observe the data and answer the question.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="files-you-need-to-submit">Files you need to submit</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Recipe and Data</em> You need to download the wrangler “recipe” (script) and “sample data as csv” as follows: The recipe is simply a text file with a sequence of transformations. And the sample is your final table.
    <ul>
      <li><img src="../files/hdisys/wrangler-export.gif" style="width: 400px;" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Screenshot and Short Answers in One pdf file</em>  You need to create a screenshot of your dashboard like below. Make sure the picture/pictures includes ALL your recipe steps. Then, insert your sceenshot in your pdf file and answer the question above.
    <ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="dbt-extract-load-transform-using-sql">DBT: Extract-Load-Transform using SQL</h2>

<p>We will be using the <a href="https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends">Incarceration Trends</a> dataset collected by the Vera Institute.   We will be using the <a href="https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends/blob/master/incarceration_trends.csv?raw=true">county-level data file</a>. Open the <a href="https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends/blob/master/incarceration_trends-Codebook.pdf?raw=true">Codebook</a>. Starting from page 11, it describes the attributes in the dataset.  Notice how a lot of attributes are actually encoded in the attribute names.  For instance, aapi_pop_15to64 is a numeric value that stores the population count for Asian American/Pacific Islanders aged 15 to 64.  This should clearly be three separate attributes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">population</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ethnicity</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">age</code>.  The same is true for almost all of the measures.</p>

<p>You will use DBT to turn this dataset into a well-formed table.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation">Install dbt</a> or use their dbt cloud (you’re on your own!)</li>
  <li><a href="https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals">DBT Tutorial</a> (You will need to create an account for dbt)</li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/columbiaviz/dbt-assignment">Instructions to run dbt locally</a></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="note">Note:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>You can use any other DBT supported datawarehouse also like Redshift, BigQuery, Apache Spark, Databricks, etc. as per your preference.</li>
  <li>You can use either DBT-Cloud or DBT locally on your computer to perform this assignment. There is no need to do both.</li>
  <li>You can refer to the submission section on instructions of what needs to be submitted.</li>
  <li>There are two submission options for DBT, feel free to submit any of the two.</li>
</ul>

<p>This type of data, where lots of metadata is encoded in the attributes and described in a codebook, is incredibly common in public data repositories.  It’s an open problem how to automatically/best transform these types of data into well-formed tables.</p>

<p>Questions you will answer in the google form:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What does DBT do well in solving this problem?  What limitations does it have?</li>
  <li>What would Wrangler do well in solving this problem?    What limitations would it have?</li>
  <li>What might be a human data interface design to aid this task?    Consider the language, the interface design, the interactions, the tasks.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="notes-1">Notes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Note that the transformations you performed are called “second-order”, because you are manipulating/querying the schema definitions as if they are data.   There’s an awesome paper called <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.46.9541&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">SchemaSQL</a> that defined a second order language for this type of stuff!</li>
